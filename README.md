# BarcodeMaster

The BarcodeMaster is a small project I created to easily generate Barcodes whenever I need some. Currently, the code only supports Code39, which includes the Characters from A-Z uppercase, 0-9 and - . [space] $ / + %

# Usage

Just copy and paste the code into your project, or use a precompiled DLL
